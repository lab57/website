# My Personal Website

Written in React & Next.js. The site includes a numerical simulation of the Lorenz system, written in javascript. This can be found in ./components/Lorenz.js.


## Future Tasks:

- Add 'blogging' system for adding details about various projects
    - Include tagging, sorting
    - Maybe based on markdown source files?
- Optimize for viewing on mobile aspect ratios
    - Change system to RÃ¶ssler system when viewed like this? May fit better on vertical screen
    - Or rotate Lorenz vertically
    - Or just have it randomize a system with attractors on load
- Make navbar fixed in position, have content scroll under it
